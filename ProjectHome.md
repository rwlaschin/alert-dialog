Simple tool that creates floating alerts/messages at the top center of the screen.  Messages are added to a priority queue and disappear after a few seconds.

Provides interface for Error, Warning, Debug, and Info.  There is a generic interface for messages with custom colors.

Does not use any external libraries to limit conflicts.  Also performs some namespace hiding.
